The default settings of the PHP Error Log file varies from OS to OS. The location of the error log file itself can be set manually in the php.ini file. On a Windows server, in IIS, it may be something like `error_log = C:\log_files\php_errors.log` in Linux it may be a value of `/var/log/php_errors.log`.
